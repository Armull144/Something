# Something
This program takes the user's name, major and a number representing what year of college they are in. It then outputs a print statement of their name and major with the corresponding title to their year.

We chose the standard code of conduct option offered by GitHub. This option was the best for our project because it uses the standards common for the rest of GitHub and given the size of the project, we didn't really need anything more serious than that. 

We chose the MIT Liscense since it is a permissive liscence which means that the only requirement to use our code is to include a copy of the license text and the original copyright notice. With the simplisity of our code there doesn't need to be a stricter liscence for our project.
