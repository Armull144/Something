# Something
This program takes the user's name, major and a number representing what year of college they are in. It then outputs a print statement of their name and major with the corresponding title to their year.

We chose the standard code of conduct option offered by GitHub. This option was the best for our project because it uses the standards common for the rest of GitHub and given the size of the project, we didn't really need anything more serious than that.
