# Something
This program asks the users for their name and if they are an undergrad or high school student. Depending on their answer, the program will ask for a number representing what year of college they are in or if they are still in high school, and then ask for their major if they are an undergrad student. Then it asks the user if they would like to see a picture of a bird or cat. The output is a print statement of their information that the program collected and then picture of the animal they selected.

We chose the standard code of conduct option offered by GitHub. This option was the best for our project because it uses the standards common for the rest of GitHub and given the size of the project, we didn't really need anything more serious than that. 

We chose the MIT Liscense since it is a permissive liscence which means that the only requirement to use our code is to include a copy of the license text and the original copyright notice. With the simplisity of our code there doesn't need to be a stricter liscence for our project.
